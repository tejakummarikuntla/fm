          <h4>Guest Introduction:</h4>
          <p>
            Micheal is an amazing mentor, teacher and a software developer with
            over 20 years of experience he has taught over 100s of week-long
            training courses to professional software development teams
            throughout the world across 4 continents and has spoken at a number
            of US and International conferences including NDC, DevWeek and many
            others. On top of all of that, He’s Founder and Host of the top
            Python Podcast “Talk Python to me” and he’s also the Founder and
            host of another successful podcast called “Python Bytes”, this is
            phenomenal, he hosted over 280 guests and I’ve been following his
            work for quite a long time from my 1st year in engineering and he
            had interviewed many creators in the python community and incredible
            technical leaders on the planet. I highly recommend checking out
            “Talk Python to me” Podcast at Talkpython.fm. Besides that, Micheal
            is deeply connected and so much involved with communities where he's
            a Python Software Foundation fellow, and he’s an Author at Manning
            Publication, who connected us today and a MongoDB Master handling
            millions of requests per month.

              That will stick with you for years, even though five people said
              it was great, one person doesn't like it, and all of a sudden
              they're gone right? one person is like dark clouds raining on you,
              and you're like "come on man, traveled like 8 times to be here"
              are you kidding me? you gotta remember that fear and that negative
              feedback, you gotta keep them in check, right? because we feel it
              stronger than it deserves to be.
