          <h4>Guest Introduction:</h4>
          <p>
            Josh Starmer is a passionate teacher who was a Genetics researcher
            at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. These days Josh’s
            focus is on mathematic education and he’s literally revamping the
            way statistics have been taught in academics. His videos on
            statistics and machine learning have over millions of views and his
            content focuses on breaking down complex topics into intuitive
            nuggets and make them reach straight into your brain, and He’s also
            an Instructor in Coursera. On top of all of that, He’s a singer,
            Songwriter, Music Graduate, Recording Artist, Holding 7 Music
            albums, I personally love and enjoy all his videos with such
            creative intros.
          </p>
          <p>Thank you so much for joining us Joshua.</p>
