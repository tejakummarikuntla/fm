          <p>
            Miguel is the staff software engineer at Lockheed Martin and works
            on Reinforcement learning, Missiles, Fire control, and Autonomous
            Systems in Denver. He is a part-time Instructional Associate at
            Georgia Institute of Technology for the course in Reinforcement
            Learning and Decision Making. He developed the Actor-critic lectures
            for Udacity Deep Reinforcement learning Nanodegree. Miguel holds a
            Master’s degree in computer science specializing in interactive
            intelligence. On top of all of that, he’s the author of the
            incredible book “Grokking Deep Reinforcement Learning’. If you are
            the one looking to adopt self-learning and Reinforcement learning,
            this episode will definitely help you
          </p>

            <h5>
              You wanna write a blog post, the challenging part is to get your
              computer, right the first few words, once you beat that, that's it
              you're hooked, you're writing, you're writing horribly and then
              you're writing better and then you're writing awesome, right. So,
              it is very interesting because the challenge is not to write, the
              problem is like you go like, "Oh, but I need to go write this
              whole book", don't do that, don't write the whole book, just write
              three words.
