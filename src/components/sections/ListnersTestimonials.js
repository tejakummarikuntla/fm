                    The work you do here is so inspirational to me.. the way of
                    speaking and providing valuable information to others is
                    fascinating.. personally I liked "on hiking your own hike" ,
                    that mostly meant my life ..on how most of the people here
                    running towards some profession that we don't want to do ..
                    I love to art works but I coudnt able to take up a career on
                    that.. listening to your podcast made a change in my
                    thinking towards a career towards my interest .. I wish your
                    work grows with lots of success.
